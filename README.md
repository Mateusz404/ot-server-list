Open Tibia (abbreviated as OT) is an open source role-playing game that allows people to create their own servers for the public to play. They may have unique content, brand-new maps, special features or even custom skill/level rates different than those in the original Tibia. Along with Open Tibia comes an Open Tibia community formed by players just like you who want to create something of their own. People within this community help each other, provide tutorials, contribute to the development of new and improved servers, among other things.
